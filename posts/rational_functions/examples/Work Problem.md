<p>
	It will take you 10 hours to paint your garage and it will take your brother 15 hours to do the same job. How long will it take if the two of you work together to paint the garage?
</p>

<br>
	Given:
<br>

`$I = 10$` hrs.

`$B = 15$` hrs.

`$T = I+B=x$`

<br>
	Solution:
<br>

`$[\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{15}=\frac{1}{x}]30x$`

<br>

`$3x+2x=30$`

<br>

`$5*5=30$`

<br>

`$x=6$` hrs.

<br>
	Conclusion:
<br>

<p>It will take 6 hours if the two of us work together to paint the garage.</p>
